Covers the seven step problem solving method (problem definition, examine the current situation, root cause analysis, action planning and testing, study the results, standardize the changes, and draw conclusions), applied concepts (Lean Six Sigma Management) and the fundamentals of teamwork, team dynamics and change management. It is expected that students will be challenged in terms of their understanding of the method, concepts, analytics, and the tools, and their application to solving 'real' operational problems. Students must attend both lecture and tutorial. Students will be required to attend meetings at industrial partner facilities. May not be held with MECH 4342 where the topic is Operational Excellence.

Today HR metrics provide a method of measuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the various functions of the HR department, thus resulting in a financially-accountable department. HR metrics quantify the cost and impact of employee programs and HR processes as well as measure the success (or failure) of HR initiatives. This course introduces students to HR metrics and measures, which include the concepts of cost per hire, yield ratio, turnover costs, training investment factor and revenue factor. This course will also address HR audits, HRIS design principles and reporting.\n-\n1.0 Credit hours\n\nExtended Education\n\nHuman Resource Management Department"
